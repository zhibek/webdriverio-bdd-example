# WebdriverIO BDD Example

An example repo, showing how **WebdriverIO** can be used with **CucmberJS**, to run traditional **BDD tests** on **NodeJS**. These tests use **Chromedriver** instead of Selenium (no Selenium required) and output results in **junit format** to the build directory.

The `steps` and `support` directories use basic definitions provided by https://github.com/webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate.


## Install
